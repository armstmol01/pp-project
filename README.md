### Dog walking + pet sitting site
This website contains an _About_ page and a _Login_ page
where clients can login to view the most recent walk and
any photos I've uploaded of their pet(s).

I use the Strava API to get route and map data for my walks. I use Leaflet (Open Street Maps) and Polyline to draw the route
on the map.
